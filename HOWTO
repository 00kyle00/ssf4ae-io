Build, then put d3d9.dll, xinput1_3.dll and icons.dds in directory containing SSFIV.exe
icons.dds can be anything consumed by D3DXCreateTextureFromFile. Default file is actually a png.

Texture should be an image with containing square icons in following layout:

UL UP UR  - up directions
L      R  - horizontal directions
DL DW DR  - down directions
LP MP HP  - punches
LK MK HK  - kicks

Original art can be viewed using extenal tools for DX api logging. 3DRipperDX works well (icons are then in texture named: afaca096.dds)

Overlay can be controlled ingame with following keys:
	F9	-	keep overlay on left
	F10	-	keep overlay on right
	F11	-	do not draw overlay
	F12	-	draw overlay/reset history

Config file for input is read only once on start of the process. 'Reasonable' defaults will be used if its not found.
